# SteveStore2

This is my project for Advanced Client Side Module in Msc in Sceince in Web Technologies. It has the Ruby code is the same in the background as in SteveStore.  

Although it goes against Ruby on rails convention rather then configuration, the goal was to change page views as well as creating, editing and destroying data from the site's database with out changing the URL. jQuery AJAX is used to acheive this effect.
